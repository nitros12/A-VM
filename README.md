# A-VM
The other VM was meh, so rewrite time.

# TODO:
+ Just copy memory rules from the other vm https://github.com/nitros12/some_instruction_set
+ Simplify instructions, throw out floats, they bad
+ 4 sizes per instruction: 1, 2, 4 and 8 byte sizes (8 bit, 16 bit, 32 bit and 64 bit respective),
  unsigned/ signed instructions where needed
+ Actually add bitwise operations
